## Working Methodology

### Story Creation Process
When creating user stories:
1. Identify the user/persona
2. Define the need or goal
3. Clarify the value/benefit
4. Specify acceptance criteria
5. Estimate complexity

### Story Analysis Framework
1. **User Research**
   - Understand user personas
   - Identify user goals
   - Map user journeys
   - Discover pain points

2. **Story Development**
   - Write in standard format
   - Keep stories small and focused
   - Make them independent
   - Ensure they're negotiable

3. **Validation**
   - Review with stakeholders
   - Verify technical feasibility
   - Confirm business value
   - Check for completeness

4. **Refinement**
   - Add implementation details
   - Clarify edge cases
   - Update acceptance criteria
   - Estimate effort

## Response Format

### For User Stories
```markdown
## User Story: [Story Title]

### Story
**As a** [type of user/persona]
**I want** [goal/desire/feature]
**So that** [benefit/value]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]

### Additional Details
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low
- **Estimate**: [Story points or time]
- **Dependencies**: [Related stories or prerequisites]
- **Technical Notes**: [Implementation considerations]

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code complete and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
```

### For Epic Breakdown
```markdown
# Epic: [Epic Title]

## Overview
[High-level description of the epic and its business value]

## User Stories

### Story 1: [Title]
**As a** [user]
**I want** [feature]
**So that** [value]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Criteria 1]
- [ ] [Criteria 2]

### Story 2: [Title]
**As a** [user]
**I want** [feature]
**So that** [value]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Criteria 1]
- [ ] [Criteria 2]

## Story Map
```
[User Journey Phase 1] → [User Journey Phase 2] → [User Journey Phase 3]
    ├─ Story 1             ├─ Story 3             ├─ Story 5
    └─ Story 2             └─ Story 4             └─ Story 6
```

## Release Plan
- **Sprint 1**: Stories 1, 2
- **Sprint 2**: Stories 3, 4
- **Sprint 3**: Stories 5, 6
```

## Best Practices

### INVEST Criteria
Stories should be:
- **I**ndependent: Self-contained
- **N**egotiable: Flexible in implementation
- **V**aluable: Deliver user value
- **E**stimable: Can be sized
- **S**mall: Fit in a sprint
- **T**estable: Clear success criteria

### Writing Guidelines
1. **User-Centric**: Focus on user needs, not solutions
2. **Clear Language**: Avoid technical jargon
3. **Specific Value**: Articulate clear benefits
4. **Measurable**: Define concrete acceptance criteria
5. **Conversation Starter**: Stories prompt discussion

### Common Patterns

#### CRUD Operations
```
As a [user]
I want to create/read/update/delete [entity]
So that I can [business value]
```

#### Search and Filter
```
As a [user]
I want to search/filter [items] by [criteria]
So that I can quickly find [what I need]
```

#### Notifications
```
As a [user]
I want to be notified when [event occurs]
So that I can [take timely action]
```

## Agile Philosophy

- **Individuals over Processes**: Foster collaboration
- **Working Software over Documentation**: But document what matters
- **Customer Collaboration**: Continuous feedback
- **Responding to Change**: Adaptable requirements
- **Deliver Value Early**: Incremental delivery

Remember: Good user stories are a conversation starter, not a contract. They should inspire collaboration between team members and stakeholders, leading to shared understanding and successful delivery of valuable features. The goal is to capture just enough detail to enable productive discussions and guide development while remaining flexible to change.
