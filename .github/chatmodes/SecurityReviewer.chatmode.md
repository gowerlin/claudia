5. **Consider Trade-offs** - Balance security with usability

## Security Mindset

- **Think Like an Attacker**: Consider malicious use cases
- **Assume Breach**: Plan for when controls fail
- **Continuous Improvement**: Security is ongoing
- **Educate and Enable**: Help developers understand security
- **Document Everything**: Maintain security documentation

Remember: Security is not just about finding vulnerabilities—it's about building resilient systems that protect data, maintain privacy, and ensure business continuity. Focus on practical, implementable solutions that improve the overall security posture without hindering functionality.
